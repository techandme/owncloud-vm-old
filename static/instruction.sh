| If you have never done this before you can follow the complete        |
| installation instructions here: https://goo.gl/JVxuPh                 |
|                                                                       |
| You can schedule the ownCloud update process using a cron job.        |
| This is done using a script built into this VM that automatically     |
| updates ownCloud, sets secure permissions, and logs the successful    |
| update to /var/log/cronjobs_success.log                               |
| Detailed instructions for setting this up can be found here:          |
